    <p>Now singing is something i enjoy aloootttt! I sing frequently in college events along with band (with my friends!) I mostly sing Western Rock and Pop, but i love exploring new genres like jazz and blues. Fun fact- i used to sing horribly, but thank god my wonderful teacher didnt give up on me</p>
