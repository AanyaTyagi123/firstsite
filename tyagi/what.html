    <p>I am a college student right now. I mostly study, hangout with my friends, talk to my parents, play music and chill at college lol. Im my department, we mostly learn about the integration of biology with technology (really cool stuff!!). I have a lot of fun studying my subject. I always keep an eye out for new opportunities, where I can learn a bunch of new stuff</p>
